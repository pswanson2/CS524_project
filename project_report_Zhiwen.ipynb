    "\n",
    "This project develops an algorithm to help students in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Computer Sciences department develop an optimal schedule based on their interests. In addition to providing their optimal schedule, the algorithm will provide insights into different course types as well as what careers these courses can lead them into. For example, courses in computer archetecture may lend someone different career options than courses in information security.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm takes into account course pre-requesites, students' areas of interest within computer science, courses' diffiulties (Average GPA), as well as areas of pursuits (industrial or academic). Furthermore, this project explores the trade-off between weights of areas of interests, grades, and area of pursuits in finding each student's optimal schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purposes of this project are to:  \n",
    "1. look for an algorithm to best serve the students as they go through a computer science program  \n",
    "2. give Computer Science programs across the country ways to analysize the fit for their program in industry and / or academia  \n",
    "3. give advisors of Computer Science programs better insights to better serve their undergraduate students  \n",
    "4. provide social scientists and other social, administrative, political workers insights of computer science trends within American Higher Education. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project does not take into account of any statistical samples. This project solely looks for an algorithm to solve the optimization problem. See Future Work and Application in section 4 for how this algorithms can be applied."

    "\n",
    "Based on pre-requisite and graduation requirement, model 1 gives a CS student the easiest course load to graduate. The recommended list include some non-popular courses and the student can further explore on them. With the highest possible GPA in CS courses, the student may find it easier to look for jobs or apply for graduate programs. Avoiding the challenging courses, the student will also face less pressure during study. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some limitations in this model. For example, course credit is not reflected in GPA calculation as each course is weighted equally, and therefore, the optimal GPA is not precise. However, if course credit is included, the model will turn into a complicated non-linear programming model, which can be hard to solve. Furthermore, the calculated optimal GPA will not lose too much precision since most courses have three or four credits. Therefore, course credit is left out of the model. A major limitation of this model is that some courses in the generated list are not useful and in reality, a student will not take them even if they boost GPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next steps, we plan to print the course list as a rough schedule so the student can better know how to take theses courses. We will also complete model 2 and compare it with model 1.\n"
