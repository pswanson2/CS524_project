    "This project develops an algorithm to help students in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Computer Sciences department develop an optimal schedule based on their interests. Users of the algorithm will be able to find a course list that satisfies all departmental degree requirements while maximizing the average GPA earned in each class, and they also have the option to find a  course list that satisfies all departmental degree requirements while maximizing the number of classes that focus on an area of Computer Sciences in which they are particularly interested. For example, a student can choose to focus on information security during their time in the Computer Sciences program, and the algorithm will give them a schedule with the maximum possible number of courses with that focus while still satisfying all degree requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for such a tool has been present for a long time. Every semester around course enrollment time, students spend hours searching each class, and trying to decide if they are interested in taking a class, and whether it will fit in their schedules. Some students are only interested in getting into the easiest classes, while others have specific interests that they would like to spend all of their class time learning about. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many students use the website [madgrades.com](madgrades.com) to look at the grade distribution of previous semesters of courses they want to take, and the dataset used by that website is all online in a relational database. Using this database, we wrote queries to extract every course that could fulfill any requirement for the Computer Sciences major, along with their corresponding average GPAs. In order to determine the prerequisites of each course, we manually curated a graph structure by reading off the [Computer Sciences webpage](https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/computer-sciences/computer-sciences-bs/#requirementstext). In order to determine which area of computer sciences a particular class focuses on, we read the course description and filled in a graph structure based on that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm takes into account course prerequisites, students' areas of interest within computer science, and course difficulty (Average GPA). Furthermore, this project explores the trade-off between areas of interests and average GPA to find each student's optimal schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purposes of this project are to:  \n",
    "1. look for an algorithm to best serve the students as they go through the computer sciences program  \n",
    "2. give advisors of the Computer Sciences program information to better serve their undergraduate students  \n",
    "3. provide social scientists and other social, administrative, political workers insights of computer science trends within American Higher Education. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we will develop two models: the first will find the easiest path to degree, while the second will determine the optimal schedule given a specific area of interest. In the results section, we will list all the schedules we found, given each different area of interest. See the conclusion for a summary of our findings as well as possible future directions."

    "Based on pre-requisites, graduation requirements, and grade distributions, model 1 gives a Computer Sciences student the easiest course load to graduate. With the highest possible GPA in CS courses, the student may find it easier to look for jobs or apply for graduate programs. Avoiding the challenging courses, the student will also face less pressure while studying. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some limitations in this model. For example, course credit is not reflected in the GPA calculation as each course is weighted equally, and therefore, the optimal GPA is not precise. However, if course credit is included, the model will turn into a complicated non-linear programming model, which can be hard to solve. Furthermore, the calculated optimal GPA will not lose too much precision since most courses have three or four credits. Therefore, course credit is left out of the model. A major limitation of this model is that some courses in the generated list may not be interesting to every student, which caused us to create model 2, which accounts for student interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next steps, we plan to print the course list as a rough schedule so the student can better know how to take theses courses. We will also complete model 2 and compare it with model 1.\n"

    "We have successfully found the algorithm and solved for minimal number of courses with maximal GPA needed to graduate from University of Wisconsin Madison, department of computer science. We have concluded that the results for this specific optimization problem is accurate. However, there are still limitations on GPA prediction that lead to inaccuracy. Factors including the difficulties of each class, the credit load of each class, the number of students in each class, standard deviation of total grade points are important in determining an individual GPA for a specific course. In order to take these factors into account, the model will require more data sets related to aforementioned factors and constraints. \n"
